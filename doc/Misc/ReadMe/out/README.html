<h2>About Sevenri</h2>

<p>Sevenri is a Swing-based, interactive Clojure environment written in
Clojure.</p>

<p>In Sevenri you can run application called <em>slix</em>. Sevenri comes with bunch
of slixes, such as <em>REPL</em>, Clojure editor <em>Ced</em>, and Incanter front-end
<em>Incantea</em>. With help of these slixes and powerful Clojure libraries you can
learn and study Clojure, try out your ideas and run your projects, and even
develop your own slixes, all in Clojure interactively.</p>

<h2>Current Status</h2>

<p>This version of Sevenri is an early experimental, proof-of-concept version
and runs on Mac OS X 10.6 only. Lots of features that are supposed to be in
this kind of system are missing; menus, functions and slixes for file system
and project management, customization and refactoring tools, slix UI design
and development facilities, etc. Small part is still written in Java.</p>

<p>prerequisites: <code>git</code> and <code>leiningen</code> are required.</p>
