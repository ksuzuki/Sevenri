## 3.5 Incantea

slix name: `incantea`

Incantea (pronounced "inˈkantē") is a font-end for [Incanter](http://incanter.org/) to help you work with your Incanter projects.

Libs you create using Incantea are called *spells*. Each spell has a namespace whose name begins with `library.slix.incantea.spells` and the *incant* function.  For example, the spell "open-sesame" has the namespace `library.slix.incantea.spells.open-sesame` and the function `library.slix.incantea.spells.open-sesame/incant`.

You can create and delete spells, edit spell using Ced, call the `incant` function, and open the REPL to work on spell interactively.

### 3.5.1 Incanting Spell and Rearanging Views

Let's see how Incantea works using the sample spell `sample1`. Choose `sample1` in the `Spell` listbox and then click the `Incant` button. Incantea calls the spell's `incant` function and it shows the result by opening three views.

A *view* is a window inside Incantea window (technically a view is a JInternalFrame). You open views using the `view` function and manage them using the helper functions such as the `get-views` and `do-views` functions. For example, the `sample1` spell opens three views using the `view` function and those are tiled horizontally using the `do-views` function.

You can rearrange views from the `Views...` listbox. One of the menu items is '`Fit In`'. The difference between fitting in and zooming in by clicking the green zoom (+) button in the top-left corner of view is that you can still grab the bottom-right corner of view and resize it after 'fitting in' the view, whereas the green zoom button doesn't allow it until you zoom out the view by clicking the green zoom button again.

### 3.5.2 Editing Spell

Now let's see how the `incant` function of the `sample1` spell is written. Open the spell in Ced by clicking the `Edit` button and find the function. You can see the `view` and `do-views` functions are called as explained above. Let's make a change. Instead of comparing the sales of Alice with John, do it with Rob. Change the line that looks like this:

		(with-data ($where ($fn [name] (or (= name "alice") (= name "john"))) sales)

to this:

		(with-data ($where ($fn [name] (or (= name "alice") (= name "rob"))) sales)

Save the file by pressing META+S. Then click the `Incant` button to see the new comparison result.

### 3.5.3 Interacting with Spell: The `in-spell-ns` and `create-spell-ns` Functions

You can also work with spell interactively. Open the REPL by clicking the `Repl` button. When you open the REPL from Incantea, Incantea opens a dedicated REPL window and remembers it. So when you click the `Repl` button again, Incantea doesn't open another REPL window. Instead, it brings the dedicated REPL window on the front. When Incantea quits, it closes the dedicated REPL window.

The REPL starts in the namespace `slix.incantea` instead of `user`. In order to work with spell at the REPL, you could refer to the spell's namespace or move in the spell's namespace. But Incantea has an easier and cleaner way for you; the `in-spell-ns` function. At the REPL call the `in-spell-ns` function with spell name in symbol like this:

		(in-spell-ns 'sample1)

This creates a namespace named `spell.sample1` with reference to the spell's namespace `library.slix.incantea.spells.sample1` and then set \*ns\* to the namepsce. Think it this way; the namespace `spell.sample1` is a "workbench" namespace in which you test and refine the `sample1` spell.

Move in the `spell.sample1` namespace using the `in-spell-ns` function and type "sales-2000" at the REPL. You will see the dataset as it is defined in the spell. Let's define another dataset for sales in 1999 as well and see it at the REPL.  In the spell `sales-2000` is defined like this:

		(def sales-2000 ($where {:year 2000} sales))

Define `sales-1999` similarly at the REPL.

		(def sales-1999 ($where {:year 1999} sales))

Then type `sales-1999` at the REPL and see it shows the dataset as expected. You can also open views to see the dataset from different aspects. Try these at the REPL.

		(view sales-1999)
		(with-data sales-1999 (view (bar-chart ($ :name) ($ :sold))))

The views will be opened in the Incantea window. To tile the views horizontally or vertically, call the `do-views` function.

		(do-views :tile-horizontally)
		(do-views :tile-vertically)

You can also call the `get-views` function to get all views and the `get-view` function to get a specific view. Having view you can change its properties such as name, title and size.

`sales-1999` above is defined in the `spell.sample1` namespace. Whereas `sales-2000` is defined in the `library.slix.incantea.spells.sample1` namespace. Let's move `sales-1999` to the same namespace. To do that, open the spell in Ced and insert the `sales-1999` definition line, say, above the line defining `sales-2000`. Press MEA+S to save the spell and then press F2 to load it. Back to the REPL and type `(var sales-1999)`. You can see the dataset is now defined in the `library.slix.incantea.spells.sample1` namespace. The real trick to make it happen is that the call to the `create-spell-ns` function at the end of the spell; it does the same thing as the `in-spell-ns` function except extra setup for the REPL.

### 3.5.4 The `use-incanter` Macro and The `get-using-incanter` Function

The Incanter API is divided up in several libs. By default spell uses the following Incanter libs.

> `core charts datasets processing stats`

When you use the Incanter libs in your spell, don't refer them using the Clojure's `use` function. Use the `use-incanter` macro instead. When no argument is given the macro refers to the above Incanter libs with extra setup for Incantea. When other Incanter lib names are given, the macro refers to them additionally. For example, this `use-incanter` call refers to the Incanter libs `bayes` and `distrubtions` in addition to `core`, `charts`, `datasets`, `processing`, and `stats`.

		(use-incanter bayes distributions)

As you case see, you don't need to fully qualify the lib names. To see what Incanter libs are being referred to currently, call the `get-using-incanter` function.

### 3.5.7 The incant Function

There are a few things you should keep in mind about the `incant` function.

* Clicking the `Incant` button lets Incantea call the `incant` function of the current spell.
* Incantea calls the `incant` function in another thread using the `future` function.
* In the thread the Incantea instance is set to the \*slix\* var so that the Incantea functions can refer to the instance via the var.

### 3.5.6 Adding and Deleting Spells

To add a new spell choose `New Spell` from the `Actions...` listbox and type the spell name. Translations from space to hyphen and slash to period in the name will be applied. Incantea opens the new spell filled with a template code in Ced.

To delete spell, choose `Delete...` from the `Actions...` listbox. The current spell will be deleted.

#### 3.5.7 The Sample Datasets and The \*incanter-home\* Var

[Incanter on GitHub](https://github.com/liebke/incanter) comes with sample datasets, and you can get the datasets using the Incanter's `get-dataset` function. The `get-dataset` function refers to the var `*incanter-home*` to find the `data` directory where the datasets are saved.

In Incantea the `*incanter-home*` var is set to `library.slix.incantea`. When Incantea starts, it calls the `download-datasets` funcion to download the sample datasets to the `data` directory from the Incanter repository on GitHub. If the `get-dataset` function doesn't work for some datasets or entirely, try copying the sample datasets manually to the `library.slix.incantea.data` directory.

You can customize downloading datasets and the repository URL by modifying the file `library.slix.incantea.sample-datasets`. You can also manually add datasets from a URL using the `download-datasets` function.
